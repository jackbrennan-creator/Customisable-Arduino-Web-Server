= Customisable Web Server Library for Arduino =

This library handles all the low level HTTP protocol details and 
allows a working web server to be constructed simply by specifying the
HTML to be returned to a browser client.

It is primarily aimed at ESP32 style boards and uses full Strings
extensively rather than C-strings.
